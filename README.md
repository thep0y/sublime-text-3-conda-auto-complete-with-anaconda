# sublime-text3-conda-auto-complete-with-anaconda
Conda is a convenient virtual environment management plugin, but it cannot perform code auto-completion normally. 
In order to seamlessly complete the automatic completion when switching or activating the virtual, I made a small modification to the official Conda package. 
When switching to a new virtual environment, the python interpreter in the Anaconda user-settings will be modified at the same time to complete the automatic completion.
