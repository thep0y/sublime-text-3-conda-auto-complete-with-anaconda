sublime-text-conda assumes that conda can be found in Anaconda's default install path.
If the install path was changed when installing Anaconda or if you're using Miniconda,
sublime-text-conda's settings will need to be changed in
Preferences -> Package Settings -> Conda

To start using this plugin, first select the 'Conda' build system
from Tools -> Build System. Once the build system is selected, you can access the Conda
commands via the command palette.
